Step 1: The question asks for a more detailed overview of my AI Engineer journey.
Step 2: The context includes detailed work experience at NUWA Robotics and MetaEdge as AI Engineer roles.
Step 3: I will describe my key responsibilities and accomplishments at both companies, highlighting technical skills and impacts.
Step 4: Ensure the explanation is clear and approachable for HR, emphasizing impact and collaboration.
Step 5: Suggest possible follow-up questions about specific projects or teamwork.
</thinking>

<answer>
Absolutely! At NUWA Robotics, I’ve been leading the design of a retrieval-augmented generation system from scratch, which improved recall by 30% and cut latency in half. I also developed multi-agent AI workflows that support tasks like named entity recognition and multilingual dialogue, helping over 10 enterprise clients across Taiwan, Japan, and the US adopt our solutions smoothly. Additionally, I optimized processing pipelines with RabbitMQ and asynchronous techniques to boost performance and reliability under heavy loads. 

Before that, at MetaEdge, I focused on building an in-house RAG pipeline that improved domain-specific recall by up to 20%. I also implemented semantic similarity workflows and refactored legacy AI systems, increasing efficiency and reducing memory usage significantly. Throughout these roles, I’ve worked closely with cross-functional teams to translate business needs into practical AI solutions.

If you’d like, I can tell you more about specific projects or how I collaborate with product and sales teams to align AI work with business goals.

Step 1: The question asks about challenges faced and how I handled them.
Step 2: In the <context>, I see several achievements implying challenges: building RAG systems from scratch, optimizing pipelines for latency and throughput, fine-tuning models for edge deployment, refactoring legacy systems, collaborating cross-functionally, and handling business requirements.
Step 3: I can summarize these challenges as technical complexity, performance optimization, scalability, and aligning AI solutions with business goals.
Step 4: I will answer with a few examples of challenges and how I addressed them, keeping it high-level and clear.
Step 5: Suggest possible follow-up questions about specific projects or teamwork.

</thinking>

<answer>
Throughout my AI engineering journey, I’ve encountered several challenges, especially around building scalable and efficient AI systems from scratch. For example, at NUWA Robotics, designing a full RAG system involved balancing recall improvement with reducing system latency. To tackle this, I used sparse embeddings and weighted search techniques, which helped improve recall by 30% while cutting latency by half.

Another challenge was optimizing pipeline throughput under high-load conditions. I implemented RabbitMQ combined with multithreading and asynchronous processing to ensure the system stayed reliable and fast, reducing end-to-end latency significantly.

At MetaEdge, refactoring legacy AI systems was tricky because it required improving runtime efficiency and memory usage without disrupting existing deployments. I approached this by carefully analyzing system bottlenecks and incrementally optimizing workflows, which increased efficiency by 30% and reduced memory use by 90%.

Lastly, aligning AI solutions with business needs often required close collaboration with sales and product teams, translating ambiguous requirements into clear technical goals. This cross-functional teamwork was essential in delivering AI products that truly added value to clients.

If you’d like, I’m happy to share more about how I approach problem-solving or specific challenges from any of these projects.

The question is about which vector database was used for the RAG system.

From the provided context, under "SKILLS" and "WORK EXPERIENCE" at NUWA Robotics, the candidate lists AI tools including Milvus and ChromaDB, both popular vector databases. However, the context does not explicitly state which vector database was used for the RAG system.

Given the ambiguity, the best response is to politely indicate the lack of explicit information and offer to discuss further via other channels.

Optionally, I can mention that Milvus and ChromaDB are among the tools I'm familiar with.

This aligns with the fallback approach used in previous responses about specific tech details.

No hallucination; no exact mention of vector DB usage for RAG system in the context.

Therefore, fallback reply with a friendly note and offer to discuss more.

Possible follow-up suggestion: "Would you like me to share more about the architecture of the RAG system or other tools I used?"
