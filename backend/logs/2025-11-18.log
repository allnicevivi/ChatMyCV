The question asks about my experience in developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The context provides detailed information about two roles where I worked extensively on RAG: at NUWA Robotics and MetaEdge.

At NUWA Robotics, I architected a full RAG system from scratch involving sparse embeddings, weighted search, and metadata enrichment, achieving a 30% recall improvement and 50% latency reduction. I also optimized pipeline throughput with RabbitMQ and async processing, further reducing latency.

At MetaEdge, I led development of an in-house RAG pipeline that improved domain-specific recall by 10–20%. I also implemented semantic textual similarity workflows and ensemble modeling to boost recall by 20%, ensuring production readiness and scalability.

I should synthesize this into a concise, conversational answer emphasizing technical depth and results without overloading with jargon. I can mention tools or concepts like sparse embeddings, weighted search, metadata enrichment, pipeline optimization, and recall improvements.

I should avoid inventing any details or metrics not in the context.

Optionally, I can suggest discussing architecture or performance trade-offs if the interviewer is interested.

</thinking>

<answer>
I’ve had hands-on experience building RAG systems in two roles. At NUWA Robotics, I architected a complete RAG system from scratch that used sparse embeddings, weighted search, and metadata enrichment, which improved recall by 30% and cut latency in half. I also optimized the pipeline with RabbitMQ and asynchronous processing to boost throughput and reduce end-to-end latency significantly.  

Before that, at MetaEdge, I led development of an in-house RAG pipeline focused on domain-specific data, improving recall by 10 to 20%, and implemented semantic similarity workflows to further boost performance. Across both roles, I focused on designing scalable, production-ready systems that balance accuracy and efficiency.  

If you like, I’m happy to dive deeper into the architecture choices or the trade-offs we considered around indexing and search performance.

The user wants me to elaborate on the architecture choices and trade-offs in the RAG systems I developed. According to the context, at NUWA Robotics I built a RAG system from scratch using sparse embeddings, weighted search, and metadata enrichment, improving recall by 30% and reducing latency by 50%. I also optimized throughput with RabbitMQ and async processing. At MetaEdge, I led an in-house RAG pipeline improving recall by 10-20%, using semantic textual similarity workflows and ensemble modeling. Both emphasize scalable, production-ready design balancing accuracy and efficiency.

I will provide a concise explanation of these architectural elements and trade-offs without inventing details, focusing on techniques mentioned: sparse embeddings, weighted search, metadata enrichment, async processing, semantic similarity, and balancing recall and latency.

I can suggest discussing indexing strategies or deployment challenges as follow-ups.

</thinking>

<answer>
Sure! When architecting the RAG system at NUWA Robotics, I focused on using sparse embeddings combined with weighted search and metadata enrichment to improve recall significantly while keeping latency low. Sparse embeddings helped in representing documents efficiently, and weighted search allowed prioritizing more relevant results. Metadata enrichment added context that further refined retrieval quality. To handle high throughput, I integrated RabbitMQ with multithreading and async processing, which dramatically cut end-to-end latency and maintained system reliability under load.

At MetaEdge, the pipeline emphasized domain-specific recall improvements, leveraging Semantic Textual Similarity workflows and ensemble modeling to boost accuracy further. There, the trade-offs involved balancing recall gains with maintaining production readiness and scalability, so I carefully refactored legacy workflows and optimized memory usage.

Overall, the key architectural choices revolved around balancing recall, latency, and scalability—combining efficient embeddings and search techniques with robust backend processing. If you want, I’d be happy to discuss more on indexing strategies or how we handled deployment challenges.

At NUWA Robotics, I built a retrieval-augmented generation system from scratch that improved recall by 30% and cut latency in half. I also developed multi-agent AI workflows for tasks like intent classification and multilingual dialogue, helping over 10 enterprise clients across Taiwan, Japan, and the US adopt our AI solutions. Additionally, I optimized our pipeline using RabbitMQ and asynchronous processing, reducing end-to-end latency by 50%, and fine-tuned models for edge deployment to enable real-time performance. I work closely with sales and product teams to align AI solutions with business goals, contributing to multiple client acquisitions.

The user asked for a shorter summary of the contributions at NUWA Robotics. The original detailed answer includes multiple technical achievements and client impact. I will condense this into a brief, high-level summary that highlights key outcomes and role impact, suitable for an HR audience.

Key points to keep:
- Built and improved a retrieval-augmented generation system (30% recall increase, 50% latency decrease)
- Developed multi-agent AI workflows for clients in multiple countries
- Optimized pipeline and fine-tuned models for real-time edge deployment
- Collaborated cross-functionally to support business goals and client acquisition

I will remove technical jargon and keep it concise and clear.

The question is about expected salary. The provided context includes detailed work experience and skills but does not specify salary expectations or previous salaries. According to the rules, I cannot fabricate salary information or guess it, so I must use the fallback response.

Step 2: Necessary facts (expected salary) are not in the context.

Step 3: Use fallback.

Step 4: Add a friendly invitation to continue.
